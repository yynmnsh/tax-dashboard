    <h1>ðŸ“Š Tax Compliance Research Dashboard</h1>
    <p>Insights from survey data, demographic profiles, and experimental behavior to understand tax compliance.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Survey Data Cleaning</h2>
    <p>This section ensures that only valid, unique responses are included. Duplicate entries and uniformly filled Likert-scale responses are removed.</p>
    <div id="dedup_summary"></div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Construct Reliability</h2>
    <p>We calculate Cronbach's alpha for each theoretical construct to validate internal consistency.</p>
    <div id="reliability_chart"></div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Composite Variable Distributions</h2>
    <p>Visualizes distributions of latent constructs such as Power, Trust, and General Compliance.</p>
    <div id="composite_distribution"></div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Hypothesis Testing (Slippery Slope Framework)</h2>
    <p>Regression analyses are performed to test theoretical relationships including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>General Compliance as a function of VTC, ETC, and their interaction</li>
      <li>Relationship between Power and Trust components</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="regression_vtc_etc"></div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Demographics and Compliance</h2>
    <p>This section examines the influence of age, education, and experience on compliance behaviors and attitudes.</p>
    <div id="demographics_influence"></div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Experimental Behavior and Compliance</h2>
    <p>Analysis of audit effects, ambiguity, asset groups, and real-time compliance behavior in the experiment.</p>
    <div id="experimental_behavior"></div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Compensation and Perceived Risk</h2>
    <p>We evaluate whether higher compensation correlates with better compliance and if crypto risk/trust perceptions match real behaviors.</p>
    <div id="compensation_analysis"></div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Strategy Changes and Feedback</h2>
    <p>Analysis of comments on experiment clarity and strategy changes. Potential topic modeling on qualitative feedback.</p>
    <div id="comments_feedback"></div>
